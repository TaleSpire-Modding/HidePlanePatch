# Hide Plane Patch
Local side tool that increases the cutbox size within talespire for the hide plane. This is patch was implemented as the hide plane only works for small section of large maps making it frustrating to do a proper cut-away.

## Install
Currently you need to either follow the build guide down below or use the R2ModMan. 

## Usage
Adjust the Hide Plane cut-away height, and the map will be cut away completely.
